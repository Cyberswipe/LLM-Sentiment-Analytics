# LLM-Sentiment-Analytics
An NLP based Tableau dashboard to showcase and understand LLM user sentiment based on tweets.

# Abstract
In the ever-evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought about a paradigm shift, profoundly impacting various sectors of the world. These advanced language models, with their immense computational capabilities, have transformed natural language processing, enabling applications ranging from chatbots to sophisticated language understanding.
This project delves into the societal impact of LLMs by analyzing user sentiments expressed on social media platforms. With the rapid proliferation of LLMs, public perceptions and reactions have become crucial indicators of the societal implications of these technologies. By employing sentiment analysis on tweets related to LLMs, this project aims to unravel the collective sentiments of users, shedding light on the diverse responses and attitudes towards these powerful language models. Through a combination of data mining using Python and interactive visualizations with Tableau, the dashboard seeks to create an engaging narrative around the sentiment trends, user demographics, and temporal patterns in LLM-related discourse. By harnessing the synergy of data analysis and visualization, this provides a comprehensive understanding of how the global community perceives and engages with the rise of Large Language Models and the broader implications for AI in our interconnected world.
